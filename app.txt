MPServer is the testing dev server for a future title, Midnight Pass.
This tool is used for a localhost NodeJS server that is used to correspond with the game client.
It is a prototypical tool and is not the code that will represent the final form of the MP server.
Examples of this are the lack of security and robustness missing in certain areas of functionalty.
